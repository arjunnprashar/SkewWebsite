A14 Bionic is the fastest chip in a smartphone.And it pushes what’s possible. 
Like crunching trillions of operations on the Neural Engine. Or shooting in 
Dolby Vision — even pro movie cameras can’t do that. It’s super efficient for 
great battery life. And it’s ahead of its time, prepared to power pretty much 
anything that comes next.
